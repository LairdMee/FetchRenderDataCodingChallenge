# FetchRenderDataCodingChallenge
My project is about fetching data from a Football/Soccer video API. The links are European Football/Soccer videos, which stream live games between teams with updates on scores. 

The data source is an API link -  https://www.scorebat.com/video-api/v1/  

The design decision included a page size that contains 10 urls per page. Each url is listed with bootstrap class name: list-group-item. Also, a relevant thumbnail image was added before each url, using bootstrap class name: the img-fluid img-thumbnail. Finally, h1 tags were created for the heading- European Football/Soccer- centered on the page.
